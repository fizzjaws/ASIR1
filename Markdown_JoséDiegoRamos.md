# Markdown (?)

*Markdown* is a lightweight markup language commonly used for formatting plain text documents. It was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004 with the goal of providing a simple and readable way to format text that could be easily converted to HTML. Markdown is often used for documentation, web content, and various other types of text-based communication.
